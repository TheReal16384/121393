# 121393
A fork of [2048](https://https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) by Gabriele Cirulli.  cozmic72 thought it would be nice to try the same game mechanics for other mathematical sequences... This one is using Fibonacci sequences. Next up, he is planning a version using prime factors.

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://marblelover003.github.io/121393/)

## Notes on gameplay
For fairly obvious reasons, he ommitted the 0 tile, and I have set it up to only spawn ones.
Can you achieve the 26th Fibonacci number - the 121393 tile?
